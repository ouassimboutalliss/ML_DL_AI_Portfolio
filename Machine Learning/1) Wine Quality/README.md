# Red Wine Quality 



## Summary


## Project approach:

1) Problem understanding
2) Load data
3) Data exploring (check on inconsistent data, ...
4) Clean data (outliers, missing data, ...)
5) Analyse/visualize cleaned data (corr, describe dataset, ...)
6) Data preprocessing (split training/test, normalize, pca, feature engineering, ...)
7) Choosing model (based on problem/target (supervised, unsupervised)
8) Train model
9) Evaluating model
10) Hyperparameter tuning (grid search, ...)
11) Prediction
12) Save model (pickle)
13) Build flask api 
14) Documenting work

## Data Cleaning
I needed to clean the data up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes.

## Exploring Data Analysis
I looked at the distribution of the data and the value counts for the various categorical variable. 
After that, I studied the relationships and the correlations between features. 
Below are a few highlights from the dataset.
